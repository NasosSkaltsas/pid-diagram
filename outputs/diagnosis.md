# Diagnosis

System Summary:
Components:
*   pressure indicator: S15002, S15006
*   valve: V15002, V15011, V15028, V15029
Connections:
*   V15002 is connected to S15002
*   S15002 is connected to V15011
*   V15011 is connected to V15028
*   V15028 is connected to S15006
*   S15006 is connected to V15029

Anomaly Detected:
The pressure indicator S15006 reported an observed value of 498.7 psi at 2025-10-15T10:13:00+00:00. This reading is significantly higher than its expected operational range of 101.0 - 104.0 psi.

Potential Root Causes:
1.  **Sensor Malfunction:** The pressure indicator S15006 itself may be faulty or out of calibration, leading to an inaccurately high pressure reading.
2.  **Valve Malfunction:** The upstream valve V15028 could be malfunctioning (e.g., stuck open or partially open), allowing excessive pressure to flow to S15006, or the downstream valve V15029 might be partially or fully closed, creating a pressure buildup at S15006.

Recommended Inspection/Remediation Steps:
1.  Inspect and recalibrate or replace the pressure indicator S15006 to confirm its accuracy.
2.  Check and test the functionality and position of valves V15028 and V15029, and adjust as necessary to ensure proper pressure regulation.
